Quantum: "Hey, what's your name again?"
You: "I'm not playing your stupid game this time, Quantum. You ask me this like every other week."
Quantum: "Oh that's right. You're the kid who drove away your dad the second you were born, right? What happened, bud?"
Bully1: "I heard that the dad beat HIM instead of CANCER!"
Bully2: "No no, I heard that the dad left when this kid came out of the womb because he was almost as ugly as his frat mattress of a mother!"
Bully3: "Speaking about your mother, she must be furious with the one child policy! What a waste, right?"
Bully4 (Carl): "Guys, guys, give him a break."
Quantum: "Carl, what the fuck bro? I thought we all agreed to come to school with an insult for this kid?"
Carl: "No, no, no guys. I mean.... Let's give him a.... BREAK..."
*Bullies laugh, except Quantum*
Quantum: "I'm not retarded, Carl. I heard what you said, but your comment has literally no worth in the context of an insult to this kid."
All the Boys: "..."
You: "..."
Quantum: "HEY! Stop looking at us with that stYYYYYYOOPID look on your face!"
You: "If you don't shut your mouth right now, IMMA GET IN DAT ASS, BOI."
*Just then, you spot your old history teacher, Mrs. Remington in the background with her jaw dropped and eyes wide open.*
*You sheepishly smile and give an awkward wave.*
Teacher tentatively asks: "Hey boys, what's all the fuss about?"
Quantum: "Nothing, Sally. Walk away now."
Sally: "Oh, okay Quantum. I hope you boys are playing nice! Hahaha", she nervously laughs"
Everyone else: "..."
Sally: "... Alright, well say hi to your dad for me. He's a good man, and the apple doesn't fall far from the mango tree ;)"
*Sally leaves*
Bully2: "Yeah Quanty, you're a real chip off the ol' brick ;)"
Bully3: "You and your father are really sliced from the same salami, eh? ;)"
Carl: "In one's birthday suit... completely naked! Hahahaha..."
Everyone: "..."
Quantum: "The fuck is the matter with you, Carl?"
Carl: "What, now you don't want me contributing to the conversation?"
Quantum: "Not when you're mocking me, dumbass!"
Carl: "Screw you guys, I'm going home!"
Quantum: "NO! We're gonna need the extra manpower to beat this kid to a pulp... Alright, enough of this nonsense. What were we talking about? Oh yeah, we were about to..." *pulls doughnut out of pocket, takes a bite, and spits it right out at you* "SLAMMMMMMMMM HIMMMMMMM"
