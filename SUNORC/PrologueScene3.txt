You: "Yeah... I'm good."
*The Bullies proceed to snap their fingers while inching towards you. Quantum smirks.*
Quantum: "Let's see who's gonna be getting up into who's ass NOW!"
*The boys stop everything, and turn to Quantum, who has now realized the implication of his words.*
Carl: "Getting up in his ass? Q, we're not raping this kid, right? I mean, at least WE'RE not, right?"
Quantum: "OF COURSE WE'RE NOT RAPING THIS KID! GETTING UP IN HIS ASS IN AN EXPRESSION!"
Carl: "Sure, but don't you know that the expression came from all male prisons, and 'getting up in someone's ass' means making someone your bitch through ana--"
Quantum: "I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE EXPRESSION CAME FROM, CARL. DAMN IT. It's the IMPLICATION of the phrase that was supposed to scare him."
Carl: "Alright alright alright man, calm down. Don't be "destroying my anus" because of this..."
Quantum: "THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT I SAID."
You: "Did you guys need me for all of this?"
Quantum: "SHUT UP!"
Carl: "YEAH. Let's get this rain on the parade!"
*Bullies look at Carl incredulously*
Carl: "What?"
Quantum: "Shut up Carl. Get him, boyz."
*THE BULLIES PROCEED TO SAVAGELY BEAT YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE CEMENT WALLS, LEAVING BUT A MANGLED SHELL OF YOUR BODY ON THE GROUND*
Bully2: "Take that, scumbag!"
*Your ribs are on fire*
Bully3: "Eat some dirt!"
*They kick sand into your eyes and mouth, and eyes, and mouth again; you can't see or breathe*
Quantum: "That's enough, boys. Great job."
*Q leans in, and whispers: "You good, bud?" he walks away, chuckling, with his cronies following closely behind.*
You: "At least it's over..."
*You attempt to blink through the pain, but there's so much dirt in your eyes that you can barely see two feet in front of you*
*You see the silhouette of a person approaching you, and then crouching by your side*
*The figure says: "I will go get help." Her voice was strangely monotone, and the way she talked was... unnatural.*
*I blacked out.*
